<- Vector ----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Vector class handles vectors.

An instance can be constructed from an origin and an optional destination :
new Vector(array('orig' => Vertex $orig));
new Vector(array('orig' => Vertex $orig, 'dest' => Vertex $dest));

'dest' is an optional parameter.
By default, it will be a (x: 0, y: 0, z: 0, w: 1) Vertex.

The class provides the following methods :

float	magnitude();
Returns the magnitude of the Vector.

Vector	normalize();
Returns a new clone of this Vector, normalized.

Vector	add( Vector $rhs );
Returns a new Vector resulting of addition of this one and $rhs.

Vector	sub( Vector $rhs );
Returns a new Vector resulting of substraction of this one and $rhs.

Vector	mult( $k );
Returns a clone of this Vector, multiplied by factor $k.

Vector	opposite();
Returns the opposite of this Vector, as a new instance.

Vector	scalarProduct( $k );
Returns	the scalar product of this Vectory by factor $k, as a new instance.

Vector dotProduct( Vector $rhs );
Returs the dot product with Vector $rhs.

Vector	crossProduct( Vector $rhs );
Returs the cross product with Vector $rhs.

Vector	cos( Vector $rhs );
Returns the cosinus of the angled formed by this Vector and Vector $rhs.
